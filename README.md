Introduction:

The "Snake Game " is a classic and entertaining web-based project that recreates the iconic Snake game, which gained immense popularity on early mobile phones and gaming consoles. Developed using the JavaScript programming language, this project allows users to control a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with its own tail or the game's boundaries.

Key Features:

    Snake Movement: The core feature of the game is the snake's movement. As the game starts, the snake begins moving in a specified direction automatically. The player can change the snake's direction using arrow keys or other designated controls.

    Food Generation: The game generates food items randomly on the screen. When the snake consumes food, its length grows, adding to the player's score.

    Collision Detection: To ensure gameplay integrity, the project incorporates collision detection. The game detects collisions between the snake's head and its body or the game's boundaries, resulting in a game-over scenario.

    Scoring: The project keeps track of the player's score, increasing it each time the snake eats a food item. The higher the score, the more successful the player's performance.

    Game Over and Restart: When the snake collides with itself or the game's boundaries, the game ends, and the player is presented with a game-over screen. They have the option to restart the game and try to achieve a higher score.
